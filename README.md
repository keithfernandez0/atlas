# Atlas

Atlas is a terminal-first reconnaissance knowledge graph that transforms network discovery data into an interconnected Obsidian workspace.

The initial implementation focuses on Nmap XML parsing, automatically generating linked Markdown notes for hosts, services, and scan sessions. The long-term goal is to evolve Atlas into a modular systems engineering and cybersecurity knowledge platform capable of indexing network reconnaissance, reverse engineering artifacts, source code relationships, and digital forensics evidence.

## Features

* Project-based Obsidian workspace generation
* Automatic Nmap XML export and parsing
* Linked host, service, and scan notes
* Persistent scan history
* Metadata-rich Markdown suitable for Graph View
* Terminal-first workflow

## Planned

* Network topology inference
* Masscan and RustScan support
* Packet capture ingestion
* Reverse engineering graph generation (rizin/radare2/GDB)
* Source code indexing (ctags, tree-sitter, libclang)
* Interactive TUI
* Optional local LLM terminal integration (non-agentic)
